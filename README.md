# Paperless-ngx-Sensor

# Scope

This is a Luup plugin to keep an eye on your Paperless-ngx instance - https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx

Luup (Lua-UPnP) is a software engine which incorporates Lua, a popular scripting language, and UPnP, the industry standard way to control devices. Luup is the basis of a number of home automation controllers e.g. Micasaverde Vera, Vera Home Control, OpenLuup.

# Compatibility

This plug-in has been tested on the Ezlo Vera Home Control system.
You need a Paperless-ngx instance running which you can access 

# Features

It supports the following functionality:

* Creation of a device in the UI to show your Paperless-ngx configuration
* Periodically updates the number of documents etc 

Still to be added..

* Add a button to refresh labels on demand
* Add default variable to show other system label information
* other fixes/updates

# Imstallation / Usage

This installation assumes you are running the latest version of Vera software.

1. Upload the icon documents.png file to the appropriate storage location on your controller. For Vera that's `/www/cmh/skins/default/icons`
2. Upload the .xml and .json file in the repository to the appropriate storage location on your controller. For Vera that's via Apps/Develop Apps/Luup files/
3. Create the decice instance via the appropriate route. For Vera that's Apps/Develop Apps/Create Device/ and putting "D_xxxxxxxxx.xml" into the Upnp Device Filename box. 
4. Reload luup to establish the device and then reload luup again (just to be sure) and you should be good to go.

# Quick Configuration script

After you have added the files and created the device, the following is a quick way to configure the device, simply update the following and run it via Apps/Develop Apps/Test Code 

````
local DEVICE = 1210
local SERV = "urn:nodecentral-net:serviceId:Paperless1"
local Username = "yourusername"
local Password = "yourpassword"
local IpPort = "192.168.1.234:8777"
luup.variable_set(SERV, "Username", Username, DEVICE)
luup.variable_set(SERV, "Password", Password, DEVICE)
luup.variable_set(SERV, "IpPort", IpPort, DEVICE)
luup.reload()
````

# Limitations

While it has been tested, it has not been tested very much and may not support other related devices or those running different firmware.
